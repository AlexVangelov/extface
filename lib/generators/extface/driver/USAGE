Description:
    Generate new device driver skeleton. There are 4 driver categories:
    RAW - any non-profiled device (send and receive data)
    PRINT - print and render functionality
    FISCAL - fiscal memory devices, process of Billing::Bill object (require gem billing)
    REPORT - logging devices (receive only)

Example:
    `rails generate extface:driver vendor/device_name [raw|print|fiscal|report]`

    This will create:
        app/models/extface/driver/<vendor>/<device_name>.rb
        app/views/extface/driver/<vendor>/<device_name>/_settings.html.erb
        app/views/extface/driver/<vendor>/<device_name>/_control.html.erb
        test/models/extface/driver/<vendor>/<device_name>_test.rb
